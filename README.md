pthreads-polyfill
---------------

*pthreads-polyfill* aims to satisfy the API requirements of *pthreads* classes such that code written to depend on *pthreads* will work when pthreads is not, or can not be loaded.

*pthreads-polyfill* does not implement the same execution model, for obvious reasons and has no external dependencies.

Note that *pthreads-polyfill* aims to provide compatiblity with pthreads v3, currently pthreads v2 is unsupported.
