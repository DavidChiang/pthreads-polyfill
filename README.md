pthreads-polyfill
---------------

*pthreads-polyfill* aims to satisfy the API requirements of *pthreads* classes such that code written to depend on *pthreads* will work when *pthreads* is not, or can not be loaded.

*pthreads-polyfill* does not implement the same execution model, for obvious reasons, and has no external dependencies.

*pthreads-polyfill* will fill for v2 or v3.
